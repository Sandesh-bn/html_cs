    <!-- Since the way weights are defined varies
        from font to font, the predefined values may
        not be relative from font to font. They are
        designed to be relative within a given font
        family.
        If the font family has fewer than nine
        weights, or if they are concentrated on one
        end of the scale, some numeric values will cor-
        respond to the same font weight.
        For the reasons noted in the previ-
        ous two tips, it’s customary to assign bold
        simply with font-weight: bold, which will
        always work.

    <!-- FONT SIZE
      There are two basic ways to set the font
      size for the text in your Web page. You can
      mandate that a specific size be used A,
      or you can have the size be relative to the
      element’s parent font size C.
      Setting the size relative to the parent takes
      a little getting used to; you need to under-
      stand how the browser treats these units
      relative to their parents, and I’ll explain that
      more in a minute.
      But first, when you use this method
      it’s best to establish a baseline on the
      body element, namely by declaring
      body { font-size: 100%; } C. Most of the
      time, this sets the size to the equivalent of
      16px, which is the default font size on most
      systems. As usual, that value cascades
      down to the other elements (remember,
      font-size is an inherited property) unless
      given their own font-size.

      If you set the font size with pixels,
      visitors using Internet Explorer will not be
      able to make the text bigger or smaller with
      the browser’s text size option. That’s one
      argument for sizing your fonts with ems or
      percentages. Beginning with IE7, visitors can
      zoom the entire page in and out, which is
      an improvement over IE6, though it isn’t the
      same as changing only the text size.

      CSS3 introduces some new units. One of
      the most interesting ones is rem, short for root
      em. It’s like em, but it sizes everything relative
      to the root, so you don’t have to do the parent
      element font size division I described for ems.
      Browser support is strong in modern browsers.
      Internet Explorer didn’t support it until version 9
    -->

    <!-- Line height
      amount of space between each line a paragraph.
      line-height: n; // n times font-size for the element
      line-height: a ems;
      line-height: p %;

      n will be inherited by all children. so if parent's font size is 16 then line height
      will be 24.(16 * 1.5). if child's font size is 10. It's line height will be 15.
    -->
    <p style="line-height:2;">Line height 2n</p>
    <p style="line-height:3;">Line height 3n</p>
    <p style="line-height:4;">Line height 4n</p>

    <!-- word-spacing space bw words letter-spacing space bw letters
      word-spacing: len;
      letter-spacing: len;
       len is in px or em
       If you use an em value, only the resulting
      size (or “computed value”) is inherited. So, a
      parent at 16 pixels with .1em of extra word-
      spacing will have 1.6 pixels of extra space
      between each word. And all child elements will
      also have 1.6 pixels of extra space between
      words, regardless of their font size. Set the
      extra spacing explicitly for the child elements
      if you need to override such a value.
      The word-spacing and letter-
      spacing properties are inherited.

    <!-- styling links
    In most cases, you’ll probably have a generic a style,
    :visited, and :hover styles
    in your style sheets. For maximum design control you may want to style all the dif-
    ferent states. But for that to work, you must specify the links in a particular order:
    link, visited, hover, and active. Use this easy mnemonic to remember it: Love/
    HAte. So here’s the proper way to add all four link styles:
    a:link { color: #F60; }
    a:visited { color: #900; }
    a:hover { color: #F33; }
    a:active {color: #B2F511; }

    If you want to get really fancy with your CSS, you can combine the attribute selector with the CSS3
:not() selector to create a single style that will affect all absolute URLs
except
ones pointing to your own site:
a[href^='http://']:not(a[href^='http://www.mysite.com'])
This crazy-looking selector translates to “select all links that begin with
http://
, but
not
the ones that begin with
http://www.mysite.com.” The downside of this technique is that Internet Explorer 8 and earlier don’t understand
the :not() selector.

a[href^='mailto:'] email links
a[href$='.zip']: zip link
a[href$='.pdf']: pdf links

    <!-- Layout
          A fixed layout has pixel-based widths
      for the whole page and for each column
      of content. As its name suggests, its
      width doesn’t change when viewed
      on smaller devices like mobile phones
      and tablets or when a desktop browser
      window is reduced. Chances are you’ve
      seen many fixed layouts when browsing
      the Web, particularly on corporate and
      big-brand sites. Fixed layouts are also
      the easiest to get the hang of when
      learning CSS.

      n	 A fluid (or liquid) layout uses percent-
      ages for widths, allowing the page to
      shrink and expand depending on the
      viewing conditions. This approach
      has been enhanced of late to create
      responsive and adaptive layouts, which
      can not only shrink for phones and  tablets like traditional fluid layouts, but
      also shift their design in specific ways
      based on the screen size. This allows for
      tailoring the experience to mobile, tab-
      let, and desktop users independently,
      but with the same HTML, not with three
      different sites.

      An elastic layout uses ems for both
      width and all other property sizes, so
      the page scales according to a user’s
      font-size settings.

    <!-- Layout recipe

    <!-- supporting html5 elements in older browsers
      include html5.js(from googlecode) in the header after all other link-style tags
          There is one drawback to this approach
      and these alternative options. Because
      styling HTML5 elements in IE6 through IE8
      requires JavaScript, users whose browsers
      don’t support JavaScript or have it dis-
      abled will see unstyled and possibly messy
      HTML5 elements. You might be OK with
      this risk if it’s one of your own sites; many
      designers and developers are. However,
      if you're doing work for a client, you may
      want to get their clearance before you use
      the HTML5 elements that are intended to
      display as blocks. They may also have user
      analytics concerning browser usage to
      inform the decision.

    <!-- use css normalizer which will make the default style consistent across all browsers -->

    <!-- box model
        css treats every element as a boxx.
        box has width, height, border, padding and margin

        outside edge of padding is border-top
        space between border and adjacent elements is margin-bottom

        normal document flow: elements are laid in the order
        they are coded with each blcok level element occupying its own line.

        you cannot set width or height for inline elments unless you set its display
        to inline block or display block

        widht and height are not inherited.

      <!-- units of  measurement
        % is relative to parent's size and not the element itself

      -->

      <!-- always use min-height over height
      However, if you always want the element to be at least a certain height, set a min-height. If the
      content later grows, the element’s height will grow automatically as desired. That is the difference
      between height and min-height, as well as width and min-width.
      And in case you’re wondering, there are a variety of reasons content might grow. Your content
      might come from a database or a feed or be user-generated. Also, your visitor may increase the
      font size in his or her browser, overriding the style you specified.

    	 The League of Moveable Type (www.
      theleagueofmoveabletype.com)
       FontShop (www.fontshop.com)

       All of those fonts need to be downloaded
        to the user’s computer before they can be
        rendered on the page. If you have half a
        dozen fonts on a page, this can slow down
        the Web site, especially for mobile users.
        My recommendation to you is to be pru-
        dent with your Web font choices. If you find
        yourself using seven Web fonts, then look
        for ways to consolidate your font choices.
        One way to save some page weight is
        through subsetting. Subsetting is a way
        to trim down the size of the actual font by
        only including the characters you know
        you will use. For instance, if you are using
        League Gothic for headlines, but the
        design of the site requires that the head-
        lines are always in all caps, then there is no
        need for lowercase letters. Using subset-
        ting, you can remove those letters from the
        font, and the font’s file size will be measur-
        ably smaller.

      Typically implemented using JavaScript,
      polyfills enable a degree of support for
      HTML5 and CSS3 APIs and properties in
      less-capable browsers while silently falling
      back to official support when the capabili-
      ties exist natively in a browser. It’s impor-

      tabs into the field. blur is activated once it loses focues
      Form controls with the disabled attribute aren’t submitted along with the form so
      their values will be inaccessible to your form processing code on the server side. If
      you want a form value that users are unable to edit but can still see and submit, use
      the readonly attribute.
      The readonly Attribute
      The readonly attribute is similar to the disabled attribute: it makes it impossible
      for the user to edit the form field. Unlike disabled, however, the field can receive
      focus and its value is submitted with the form.
      you can make submit button blurred until all the required field is submitted.

      In order to disable autocomplete on a form control (or form), use autocomplete="off". This
      is a good idea for sensitive information, such as a credit card number, or data that
      will never need to be reused, such as a CAPTCHA.`

      The number input has min, max, and step attributes to specify the minimum, max-
      imum, and incremental values allowed. If the step is omitted it defaults to 1. If you
      would like to allow float values, you must specify a float step, such as 0.1 or the
      keyword any to allow for any value. Note that some browsers will minimize the
      width of the number form field for restricted numbers. For example, min="0"
      max="10" step="1" doesn't need to be as wide as step="any", where the user could
      enter the full value of Pi.

     But polyfills aren’t perfect. Some rely on other technologies that may be only partly
     supported. For example, one polyfill allows you to emulate the HTML5 canvas on
     old versions of Internet Explorer using the Silverlight plug-in. But if the web visitor
     isn’t willing or able to install Silverlight, then you need to fall back on something
     else. Other polyfills may have fewer features than the real HTML5 feature, or poorer

     the input fields based on whether or not they’re validated. For example, you can
     give invalid values a different background color, which will appear in the text box
     as soon as the browser detects the problem.

     For example, if you want to give required <input> fields a light-yellow background,
     you could use a style rule with the required pseudo-class:
     input:required {
       background-color: lightyellow;
     }
     Or, you might want to highlight only those fields that are required and currently
     hold invalid values by combining the required and invalid pseudo-classes like this:
     input:required:invalid {
       background-color: lightyellow;
     }

     With this setting, blank fields are automatically highlighted, because they break the
required-field rule.

      <!-- transparency
        Browsers that don’t support rgba() will just ignore this rule, and the element will
        keep its default, completely transparent background. So the second, and better,
        approach is to start by declaring a solid fallback color, and then replace that color
        with a semitransparent one:
        .semitransparentBox {
          background: rgb(170,240,0);
          background: rgba(170,240,0,0.5);
        }
        This way, browsers that don’t support the rgba() function will still color the element’s
        background, just without the transparency.

        The opacity property is a better tool than the rgba() function if you want to do any
        of the following:
        •  Make more than one color semitransparent. With opacity, the background color,
        text color, and border color of an element can become transparent.
        •  Make something semitransparent, even if you don’t know its color (for example,
        because it might be set by another style sheet or in JavaScript code).
        •  Make an image semitransparent.
        •  Use a transition, an animated effect that can make an element fade away or
        reappear
        SO DO THIS INSTEAD
        .semitransparentBox {
          background: rgb(170,240,0);
          opacity: 0.5;
        }
      -->

      <!-- @font-face
        You upload the font to your website (or, more likely, multiple versions of that
        font to support different browsers).
        2.  You register each font-face you want to use in your style sheet, using the
        @font-face command.
        3.  You use the registered font in your styles, by name, just as you use the web-
        safe fonts.
        4.  When a browser encounters a style sheet that uses a web font, it downloads
        the font to its temporary cache of pages and pictures. It then uses that font
        for just your page or website (Figure 6-13). If other web pages want to use the
        same font, they’ll need to register it themselves and provide their own font files.

        If you want to use the @font-face feature and support a wide range
        of browsers, you need to distribute your font in several different formats. The best
        practice is to include a WOFF file (for optimum performance on modern browsers),
        an EOT file (to fill in the gaps on old versions of IE), and a TTF or OTF file

      .sidebar p:first-of-type : the first para under .sidebar

      :nth-of-type
      Works like :nth-child() but it applies to alternating children that have a specific tag.
      You may find this selector handy if you have something like a big paragraph of text
      that’s peppered with photos. The <img> tag is an inline tag, so you can have a <p>
      tag with a bunch of <image> tags inside it. And say you want to alternately float the
      images left and right, as shown in Figure 3-9. You can do so with these two styles:
      img:nth-of-type(odd) { float: left; }
      img:nth-of-type(even) { float: right; }

      The adjacent sibling selector uses a plus sign (+) to join one element to the next. So
      to select every paragraph following each <h2> tag, use this selector: h2 + p (spaces
      are optional, so h2+p works as well). The last element in the selector (p, in this case)
      is what gets the formatting, but only when it’s directly after its brother <h2>.

      :not  use to exclude
      p:not(.classy){}   all para without class='classy'
      a[href^="http://"]:not([href^="http://mysite.com"])  all links outside of mysite.com
      You can’t string multiple :not() selectors together. For example, the following is invalid:
      a[href^="http://"]:not([href*="google.com"]):not([href="yahoo.com])
      In other words, you can only use :not( ) once with a selector.

      Inheritance works through multiple generations as well. If a tag like the <em> or
      <strong> tag appears inside of a <p> tag, then the <em> and the <strong> tags also
      inherit properties from any style applied to the <body> tag.

      <!-- font size percentage, em

        Like keywords, percentage values adjust text in relationship to the font size defined
        by the browser, but they give you much finer control than just large
        ,
        x-large, and
        so on. Every browser has a pre-programmed base text size, which in most browsers
        is 16 pixels. You can adjust this base size in your browser’s preferences. Whatever
        setting has been chosen, the base text size for a particular browser is equivalent to
        100%. In other words, for most browsers, setting the CSS percentage to 100% is the
        same as setting it to 16 pixels.
        Say you want to make a particular headline appear two times the size of average
        text on a page. You simply set the font size to 200%, like so:
        font-size: 200%;
        Or, when you want the text to be slightly smaller than the default size, use a value
        like 90% to shrink the font size down a bit.
        The above examples are pretty straightforward, but here’s where it gets a little tricky:
        Font size is an inherited property (see Chapter 4), meaning that any tags inside of a
        tag that has a font size specified inherit that font size. So the exact size of 100% can
        change if a tag inherits a font-size value.

        there’s a <div> tag that has its font
        size set to 200%. That’s two times the browser’s base text size, or 32 pixels. All tags
        inside that <div> inherit that text size and use it as the basis for calculating their
        text sizes. In other words, for tags inside that <div>, 100% is 32 pixels. So the <h1>
        tag inside the <div> that has a font size of 100% displays at two times the base-text
      -->

      <!-- rem font size

        It stands
        for Root EM—meaning its value is based on the text size of
        the root element. In most cases this just means the base text
        size, so you can change the .75em shown in Figure 6-11 to this:
        font-size: .75rem;
        This style makes the font size .75 of the base text size, not the
        current font size (as is the case with ems). The root element in
        HTML is actually the html element you find at the beginning
        of a web page. When using rem values, you can set the base
        text size of the html element and then use rem units to set
        text to a size relative to that. For example, you can set the base
        text size to 20 pixels like this:
        html {
         font-size: 20px;
        }
        Then use rem units to create fonts in relation to that 20-pixel
        base text size. For example, to then make all paragraphs 15
        pixels in size, add this style.
        p {
         font-size: .75rem;
        }
        You should be aware, however, that while most browsers now
        understand the rem unit, Internet Explorer 8 and earlier don’

      Pixels are simple to understand and easy to use. They also create
an exact width or height that doesn’t change.
      . An em is the same as the text size for
the styled element. Say you set the text size to 24px; an em for that style is 24px,
so if you set the width to 2em, then it would be 2 x 24 or 48 pixels. I

For the width property, percentage values are based on the percentage of the
width of the style’s containing element. If you set the width of a headline to 75%
and that headline isn’t inside any other elements with a set width, then the headline
will be 75 percent of the width of the browser window. If the visitor adjusts the size
of his browser, then the width of the headline will change. However, if the headline
is contained inside a <div> (maybe to create a column) that’s 200 pixels wide, the
width of that headline will be 150 pixels. Percentage values for the height property
work similarly, but are based on the containing element’s height, instead of width.


The general rule of thumb for setting heights on page elements is
don’t!
 A lot of bud-
ding CSS designers try to set heights on everything in an attempt to get pixel-perfect
control. But unless you’re totally sure of the exact dimensions of the content inside
a tag, you can run into some unwanted results (see Figure 7-13). In this example, a
pull-quote box used to highlight an interesting comment from an article has a set
width and height of 100 pixels. When more text than fits into the 100-pixel height is
added to the box, its contents spill out the bottom. Even if you make sure that the
text you put inside a box with a fixed height fits, if a visitor increases the font size
in her browser, the text might resize to a height larger than the box.
In other words, the height property is useful for controlling the height of a div
containing images, for example, because you can correctly determine the height of
the images; however, if you use the height for elements that have text, make sure to
not only test your pages in the major browsers, but also test the page with different
font sizes by increasing the font size in the web browser.

When using percentages with multiple columns, you can run into some weird prob-
lems. Say you have two columns (really, two tags, such as <div> tags), and you want
each to be 50 percent of the width of the window. So you set the two columns to
a width of 50%; however, the moment you add padding or a border to one of the
columns, you’ll increase its width to more than 50% (to be exact, it will be 50% plus
the amount of left and right padding and the width of the left and right borders). In
most cases, this will force the second column to drop
below
 the first.
 you can use box-sizing property to eradicate this problem.
 •	 The content-box option is the way browsers have always defined the screen
width and height of an element, as described on page 213. That is, the browser
adds the border widths and padding thicknesses to the values set for the width
and height properties to determine the tag’s onscreen width and height. Since
this is the default behavior, you don’t need to specify anything for content-box.
•	 The padding-box option tells a browser that when you set a style’s width or
height property, it should include the padding as part of that value. For ex-
ample, say you give an element 20 pixels of left and right padding and set the
width of the element to 100 pixels. The browser will consider the padding part
of that 100-pixel value. In other words, the content area will be only 60 pixels
wide (100 – 20 [left padding] – 20 [right padding]).
•	 The border-box value includes both the padding and the border thickness as
part of the width and height values. This setting solves the problem of using
percentage values for widths discussed above. In other words, with the box-
sizing property set to border-box, when you set an element’s width to 50%,
for instance, that element will take up 50 percent of the space, even if you add
padding and borders to that element.

        In other words, as a web designer, you can choose to stick with the tried-and-true
        font method—selecting fonts from the basic set installed on most computers—or use
        web fonts for greater design choice (at the cost of more work).

-->
    <!-- background images
    CSS3 adds the ability to tell a browser where the background image should begin in
relation to the border, padding, and content of an element. For example, normally
when you tile an image, it starts in the upper-left corner of the padding of an element
(see the top, middle image in Figure 8-10). However, you can reposition that image’s
starting point, using the background-origin property. It takes one of three values:
•	 border-box places the image in the upper-left corner of the area assigned to
the border (top-left in Figure 8-10).
•	 padding-box places the image in the upper-left corner of the area assigned
to the padding (top-middle in Figure 8-10). This is normally where a browser
places a background image.
•	 content-box places the image in the upper-right corner of the area assigned to
the content (top-right in Figure 8-10).

You might think that using a linear gradient would be a lot better than using
a gradient image. In some cases, that’s true. However, when adding a linear
gradient to the background of a page, the web browser literally has to redraw
that background gradient every time you resize the browser window, causing a
noticeable slowing down of the page rendering and making the page feel slow.
In addition, because linear gradients don’t work in IE 9 or earlier without some
additional code, you’ll stick with a background image for now.
