    <p>This is meter tag. At the time of this writing, meter is sup-
ported only by Chrome 11+ and Opera 11+. This
partially explains why you don’t yet see it in
the wild too much. Feel free to use it, but just
understand that most browsers will render the
meter text rather than the visual gauge by
default
      <meter low="0.25" high="0.75" optimum="0" value="0.21">low < 25%</meter>
      <meter low="0.25" high="0.75" optimum="0" value="0.51">51%</meter>
      <meter low="0.25" high="0.75" optimum="0" value="0.81">high > 75%</meter>

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>The JPEG format is good for color photo-graphs because it handles large amounts  of color and it compresses well, so your file
      sizes will be small A. It is a lossy format, so you lose some of the image’s original information when you save it as a JPEG,
      but usually this is a worthy compromise, because your pages load quickly.</p>
    <p>The PNG and GIF formats are often used when you’re saving files like logos with
      large amounts of solid colors and patterns or when you need transparency. The PNG
      and GIF formats compress areas of con-tinuous colors or repetitive patterns better
      than the JPEG format does. PNG is often he better choice, because it has a better
      compression algorithm for smaller file sizes and it has superior transparency support </p>
    <p> GIF and PNG-8 images can have only 256 colors, which is often fine
      for logos and icons.Photographs and complex illustrations
      should be saved in the JPEG or PNG-24 format, because they accommodate more
      colors in a single image.</p>
    <p>Animated images can be saved as GIFs but not as
    JPEGs or PNGs. Animation inside an image is becoming
    increasingly rare. Animation is generally created using Flash, CSS Animations, and
    JavaScript. In recent years, the use of Flash for animations on the Web has declined
    because of iOS’s lack of support for Flash and the increasing capability of JavaScript
    and CSS.</p>

    <!-- video formats
      html5 supports ogg theora, mp4, webm
      provide atleast 2 formats - mp4 and webm
      free tools that can help you with this. Here are two:
      Miro Video Converter, at www.mirovideoconverter.com
      HandBrake, at http://handbrake.fr
        src Specifies the URL to the video file.
        autoplay Automatically starts playing the video as soon as it can.
        controls Adds the browser’s default control set to the video.
        muted Mutes the video’s audio (not currently supported by any browser).
        loop Plays the video in a loop.
        poster Specifies an image file to display (instead of the first frame of the video) when it loads.
        Takes a URL to the required image file.

        width The width of the video in pixels.
        height The height of the video in pixels.

        preload Hints to the browser how much of the video it is to load. It can take three different values:
        none doesn’t load anything.
        metadata loads only the video’s metadata (e.g., length and dimensions).
        auto lets the browser decide what to do (this is the default setting).

        In that example, you added a text mes-
        sage that would be displayed to visitors
        using a browser that is not HTML5 capable.
        You can replace that piece of text with a
        standard hyperlink to the video, allowing
        the user to download the file and view it at
        their leisure.

        As well as providing a download link, you
        could (and probably should) embed a
        Flash fallback player that can play the MP4
        video file.
