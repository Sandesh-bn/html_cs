        use const for functions, and constants
        use let for all the other variables
        use object destrucuturing and spread operator whenever possible.
        template string for multilien string and strings with variable
            use descritive names

        use sprites
        put css at the top
        split css
        minify css
        avoid using style tag they are render-blocking
        use css shorthand
        
        If I want a child to update the state of its parent how would i do it?
        create a method inside of parent where we accept a parameter and call this.setState and assigne that parameter to the state.
        pass this method as a prop to child. inside of child call the method using prop object
