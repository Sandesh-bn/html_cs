             Primitive values are 
stored directly on the variable object, while reference values are placed as 
a pointer in the variable object, which serves as a reference to a location 
in memory where the object is stored.

            /*
            A function is the easiest reference type to identify because when you use 
            the typeof operator on a function, the operator should return "function":
            function reflect(value) {
                return value;
            }
            console.log(typeof reflect);    // "function"
            Other reference types are trickier to identify because, for all reference 
            types other than functions, typeof returns "object". That’s not very help-
            ful when you’re dealing with a lot of different types. To identify reference 
            types more easily, you can use JavaScript’s instanceof operator. 
            The instanceof operator can identify inherited types. That means 
            every object is actually an instance of Object because every reference type 
            inherits from Object. 
            
             If your environment is ECMAScript 5 compliant, Array.isArray() is the best way to identify arrays
             
             Perhaps one of the most confusing parts of JavaScript is the concept of 
            primitive wrapper types. There are three primitive wrapper types (String, 
            Number, and Boolean). 

            The primitive wrapper types are reference types that are automati-
            cally created behind the scenes whenever strings, num bers, or Booleans 
            are read.

            As you can see, creating an instance of the primitive wrapper type 
            just creates another object, which means that typeof can’t identify the type 
            of data you intend to store. 
            In addition, you can’t use String, Number, and Boolean objects as you 
            would primitive values. For example, the following code uses a Boolean 
            object. The Boolean object is false, yet console.log("Found") still executes 
            because an object is always considered true inside a conditional statement. 
            It doesn’t matter that the object represents false; it’s an object, so it evalu-
            ates to true.

            var found = new Boolean(false);
            if (found) {
                console.log("Found");       // this executes
            }
            
            function declaration are hoisted
            function expression, anonymous functions are not hoisted.
            
            #no overloading in js. Last declared function alwasy wins
            fun(99, 100, 101); // calls two-arg
            function fun(a, b, c){
              console.log(`three arguments ${a} ${b} ${c}`);
            }

            function fun(a, b){
              console.log(`two arguments ${a} ${b}`);
            }

            fun(2, 5, 3); // calls two-arg function
            
            The fact that functions don’t have signatures in JavaScript doesn’t 
            mean you can’t mimic function overloading. You can retrieve the number 
            of parameters that were passed in by using the arguments object, and you 
            can use that information to determine what to do. For example:
            function sayMessage(message) {
                if (arguments.length === 0) {
                    message = "Default message";
                }
                console.log(message);
            }
            sayMessage("Hello!");  
            
            By default, all properties that you add to an object are enumerable, which 
            means that you can iterate over them using a for-in loop. Enumerable 
            properties have their internal [[Enumerable]] attributes set to true. The 
            for-in loop enumerates all enumerable properties on an object, assigning 
            the property name to a variable. 
            
            var property;
            for (property in object) {
                console.log("Name: " + property);
                console.log("Value: " + object[property]);
            }
            Each time through the for-in loop, the property variable is filled with 
            the next enumerable property on the object until all such properties have 
            been used. At that point, the loop is finished and code execution contin-
            ues. This example uses bracket notation to retrieve the value of the object 
            property and output it to the console, which is one of the primary use 
            cases for bracket notation in JavaScript.
            
             var properties = Object.keys(object);
            // if you want to mimic for-in behavior
            var i, len;
            for (i=0, len=properties.length; i < len; i++){
                console.log("Name: " + properties[i]);
                console.log("Value: " + object[properties[i]]);
            }
            This example uses Object.keys() to retrieve the enumerable properties 
            from an object u. A for loop is then used to iterate over the properties 
            and output the name and value. Typically, you would use Object.keys() in 
            situations where you want to operate on an array of property names and 
            for-in when you don’t need an array.
            n o T e   There is a difference between the enumerable properties returned in a  for-in loop 
            and the ones returned by Object.keys(). The for-in loop also enumerates prototype 
            properties, while Object.keys() returns only own (instance) properties. 
            
            var person1 = {
             _name: "Nicholas",
             get name() {
                console.log("Reading name");
                return this._name;
            },
             set name(value) {
                console.log("Setting name to %s", value);
                this._name = value;
                }
            };
            
             You can also explicitly call return inside of a constructor. If the returned value 
            is an object, it will be returned instead of the newly created object instance. If the 
            returned value is a primitive, the newly created object is used and the returned 
            value is ignored.
            Constructors allow you to initialize an instance of a type in a 
             consistent way, performing all of the property setup that is necessary 
            before the object can be used. For example, you could also use Object 
            . defineProperty() inside of a constructor to help initialize the instance:
            function Person(name) {
                Object.defineProperty(this, "name", {
                    get: function() {
                        return name;
                    },
                    set: function(newName) {
                        name = newName;
                    },
                    enumerable: true,
                    configurable: true
                });
                this.sayName = function() {
                    console.log(this.name);
                };
            }
            In this version of the Person constructor, the name property is an 
             accessor property that uses the name parameter for storing the actual 
            name. This is possible because named parameters act like local variables.
            Make sure to always call constructors with new; otherwise, you risk 
            changing the global object instead of the newly created object. Consider 
            what happens in the following code:
            var person1 = Person("Nicholas");           // note: missing "new"
            console.log(person1 instanceof Person);     // false
            console.log(typeof person1);                // "undefined"
            console.log(name);                          // "Nicholas"
            
            You can determine whether a property is on the prototype by using a func-
            tion such as:
            function hasPrototypeProperty(object, name) {
                return name in object && !object.hasOwnProperty(name);
            }
            console.log(hasPrototypeProperty(book, "title"));             // false
            console.log(hasPrototypeProperty(book, "hasOwnProperty"));    // true
            If the property is in an object but hasOwnProperty() returns false, then 
            the property is on the prototype .
            
            When a property is read on an object, the JavaScript engine first 
            looks for an own property with that name. If the engine finds a correctly 
            named own property, it returns that value. If no own property with that 
            name exists on the target object, JavaScript searches the [[Prototype]] 
            object instead. If a prototype property with that name exists, the value 
            of that property is returned. If the search concludes without finding a 
            property with the correct name, undefined is returned.

            Several of the methods used in the past couple of chapters are actu-
            ally defined on Object.prototype and are therefore inherited by all other 
            objects. Those methods are:
            hasOwnProperty()  Determines whether an own property with the 
            given name exists
            propertyIsEnumerable()  Determines whether an own property is 
            enumerable
            isPrototypeOf()  Determines whether the object is the prototype of 
            another
            valueOf()  Returns the value representation of the object
            toString()  Returns a string representation of the object
            These five methods appear on all objects through inheritance
            
            The valueOf() method gets called whenever an operator is used on an 
            object. By default, valueOf() simply returns the object instance. The 
            primitive wrapper types override valueOf() so that it returns a string for 
            String, a Boolean for Boolean, and a number for Number. Likewise, the Date 
            object’s valueOf() method returns the epoch time in milliseconds (just as 
            Date.prototype.getTime() does). This is what allows you to write code that 
            compares dates such as:
            var now = new Date();
            var earlier = new Date(2010, 1, 1);
            u console.log(now > earlier);   
            
            toString()
            The toString() method is called as a fallback whenever valueOf() returns a 
            reference value instead of a primitive value. It is also implicitly called on 
            primitive values whenever JavaScript is expecting a string. For example, 
            when a string is used as one operand for the plus operator, the other 
            operand is automatically converted to a string. If the other operand is a 
            primitive value, it is converted into a string representation (for example, 
            true becomes "true"), but if it is a reference value, then valueOf() is called. 
            If valueOf() returns a reference value, toString() is called and the returned 
            value is used. For example:
            var book = {
                title: "The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript"
            };
            var message = "Book = " + book;
            console.log(message);               // "Book = [object Object]"
            
            This code constructs the string by combining "Book = " with book. Since 
            book is an object, its toString() method is called. That method is inherited 
            from Object.prototype and returns the default value of "[object Object]" in 
            most JavaScript engines. If you are happy with that value, there’s no need 
            to change your object’s toString() method. Sometimes, however, it’s use-
            ful to define your own toString() method so that string conversions return 
            a value that gives more information. Suppose, for example, that you want 
            the previous script to log the book’s title:
            var book = {
                title: "The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript",
                toString: function() {
                    return "[Book " + this.title + "]"
                }
            };
            var message = "Book = " + book;
            // "Book = [Book The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript]"
            u console.log(message);
            
            Avoid modifying Object.prototype.
            
             Given how often the for-in 
            construct is used in JavaScript, modifying Object.prototype with enumer-
            able properties has the potential to affect a lot of code. For this reason, 
            Douglas Crockford recommends using hasOwnProperty() in for-in loops all 
            the time, *  such as:
            var empty = {};
            for (var property in empty) {
                if (empty.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
                    console.log(property);
                }
            }
            While this approach is effective against possible unwanted prototype 
            properties, it also limits the use of for-in to only own properties, which 
            may or may not be want you want. Your best bet for the most flexibility is 
            to not modify Object.prototype.
            
            Because the prototype property is writable, you can change the proto-
            type chain by overwriting it. Consider the following example:
            u function Rectangle(length, width) { 
                this.length = length;
                this.width = width;
            }
            Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function() {
                return this.length * this.width;
            };
            Rectangle.prototype.toString = function() {
                return "[Rectangle " + this.length + "x" + this.width + "]";
            };
            // inherits from Rectangle
            v function Square(size) { 
                this.length = size;
                this.width = size;
            }
            Square.prototype = new Rectangle();
            Square.prototype.constructor = Square;
            Square.prototype.toString = function() {
                return "[Square " + this.length + "x" + this.width + "]";
            };
            var rect = new Rectangle(5, 10);
            var square = new Square(6);
            console.log(rect.getArea());        // 50
            console.log(square.getArea());      // 36
            console.log(rect.toString());       // "[Rectangle 5x10]"
            console.log(square.toString());     // "[Square 6x6]"
            console.log(rect instanceof Rectangle);     // true
            console.log(rect instanceof Object);        // true
            console.log(square instanceof Square);      // true
            console.log(square instanceof Rectangle);   // true
            console.log(square instanceof Object);      // true
            In this code, there are two constructors: Rectangle u and Square v. The 
            Square constructor has its prototype property overwritten with an instance 
            of Rectangle. No arguments are passed into Rectangle at this point because 
            they don’t need to be used, and if they were, all instances of Square would 
            share the same dimensions. To change the prototype chain this way, you 
            always need to make sure that the constructor won’t throw an error if the 
            arguments aren’t supplied (many constructors contain initialization logic 
            that may require the arguments) and that the constructor isn’t altering 
            any sort of global state, such as keeping track of how many instances have 
            been created. The constructor property is restored on Square.prototype 
            after the original value is overwritten.
            After that, rect is created as an instance of Rectangle, and square is 
            created as an instance of Square. Both objects have the getArea() method 
            because it is inherited from Rectangle.prototype. The square variable is 
            considered an instance of Square as well as Rectangle and Object because 
            instanceof uses the prototype chain to determine the object type. See 
            
            calling superclass method

            Square.prototype.toString = function() { 
                var text = Rectangle.prototype.toString.call(this);
                return text.replace("Rectangle", "Square");
            };
